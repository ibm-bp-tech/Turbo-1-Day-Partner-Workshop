Turbonomic observes and tracks CPU throttling. In the case of RobotShop, the response time latency of the payment service can adversely impact the ecommerce checkout experience.\nGiven the rate of throttling being observed, Turbonomic recommends increasing the CPU limit from 600 mCores to 700 mCores. Proactively alleviating CPU congestion pressures by providing these analytics-driven recommendations helps keep the application in the desired state where it meets its defined service-level objectives (SLOs).\n\n3.
