Turbonomic dynamically synthesizes a set of useful executive dashboards that help the bank better focus their cost optimization efforts. Doing this manually and continuously would be unscalable and inefficient.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of these dashboards.\n\n#### Step 2.1.1\nIn the EA - Development row of the Top Accounts dashboard, point out the values under the 30-Day Cost (1) and Potential Savings (2) columns.\n\n<InlineNotification>\nSince this is a live application, you may not see the exact same view (this caveat applies to the rest of the labs).\nIn any case, select the row that has both the 30-Day Cost and Potential Savings columns populated.\n</InlineNotification>\n\n![Lab22](images/f-2.1.1.png)\n\nThe ‘Top Accounts’ dashboard lists the bank’s most utilized public cloud accounts and their monthly costs. Taking the recommended actions can result in a large potential savings (10% in the case of this demo, but it could easily be substantially more). Saving 10-30% in a large-scale cloud environment can yield huge savings.\n\n## 2.2\tReceive recommendations for potential savings opportunities\n\n#### Step 2.2.1\nIn the Potential Savings dashboard, point out the total monthly potential savings (inside the donut chart) (1) and the breakdown list (2).\n\n<InlineNotification>\nThe numbers may be small in this case, as this is a demo environment. The potential savings in a real customer environment are significant.\n</InlineNotification>\n\n![Lab22](images/f-2.2.1.png)\n\n\nThe number inside the donut chart provides the bank an estimate of the total potential monthly savings. In the breakdown list on the right, we see that the bulk of these savings can be realized by: A) rightsizing compute instances, B) buying reserved instances, C) rightsizing storage capacity, and D) eliminating waste.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each of these savings opportunities.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"7be78e49a0aab8a62bd4a3c5de728b61","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":228},"frontmatter":{"0":"e","1":"x","2":"p","3":"o","4":"r","5":"t","6":" ","7":"c","8":"o","9":"n","10":"s","11":"t","12":" ","13":"T","14":"i","15":"t","16":"l","17":"e","18":" ","19":"=","20":" ","21":"(","22":")","23":" ","24":"=","25":">","26":" ","27":"(","28":" ","29":"<","30":"s","31":"p","32":"a","33":"n","34":">","35":" ","36":"L","37":"a","38":"b","39":" ","40":"2","41":" ","42":"-","43":" ","44":"G","45":"e","46":"t","47":"t","48":"i","49":"n","50":"g","51":" ","52":"r","53":"e","54":"c","55":"o","56":"m","57":"m","58":"e","59":"n","60":"d","61":"a","62":"t","63":"i","64":"o","65":"n","66":"s","67":" ","68":"f","69":"o","70":"r","71":" ","72":"s","73":"a","74":"v","75":"i","76":"n","77":"g","78":"s","79":" ","80":"o","81":"p","82":"p","83":"o","84":"r","85":"t","86":"u","87":"n","88":"i","89":"t","90":"i","91":"e","92":"s","93":" ","94":"<","95":"b","96":"r","97":" ","98":"/","99":">","100":" ","101":"<","102":"/","103":"s","104":"p","105":"a","106":"n","107":">","108":" ","109":")","110":";","description":"Labs / Lab 2 Finops","title":"Labs / Lab 2 Finops"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Lab 2 - Getting recommendations for savings opportunities <br />\n  </span>\n);\n---\n\n\n## 2.1\tIdentify the highest spending accounts\nBefore the bank can make any cloud cost optimization decisions, they must understand several aspects of the cloud deployment.
