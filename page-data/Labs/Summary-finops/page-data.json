They used the platform-generated analytics to identify and eliminate waste, optimize compute instances, and right-fit storage choices. This ensures their deployments are always available, performant, and cost-optimized, so the bank can achieve the lowest cost without sacrificing their performance needs.\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"184d54f86403ad2e8e9928c6e9f284c3","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":237},"frontmatter":{"0":"e","1":"x","2":"p","3":"o","4":"r","5":"t","6":" ","7":"c","8":"o","9":"n","10":"s","11":"t","12":" ","13":"T","14":"i","15":"t","16":"l","17":"e","18":" ","19":"=","20":" ","21":"(","22":")","23":" ","24":"=","25":">","26":" ","27":"(","28":" ","29":"<","30":"s","31":"p","32":"a","33":"n","34":">","35":" ","36":"S","37":"u","38":"m","39":"m","40":"a","41":"r","42":"y","43":" ","44":"F","45":"i","46":"n","47":"O","48":"p","49":"s","50":" ","51":"<","52":"b","53":"r","54":" ","55":"/","56":">","57":" ","58":"<","59":"/","60":"s","61":"p","62":"a","63":"n","64":">","65":" ","66":")","67":";","description":"Labs / Summary Finops","title":"Labs / Summary Finops"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Summary FinOps\n <br />\n  </span>\n);\n---\nSummary\n\nIn this demo, we’ve seen how the Turbonomic platform helps the FinOps team at Gen-Z Bank control their cloud costs.
