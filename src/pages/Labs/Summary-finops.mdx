Summary

In this demo, we’ve seen how the Turbonomic platform helps the FinOps team at Gen-Z Bank control their cloud costs. This was not done at the expense of application performance; Turbonomic optimizes both. Turbonomic’s cost-cutting recommendations are designed to ensure that performance is not negatively impacted.

Gen-Z Bank used the Turbonomic platform to get a deeper visibility into their cloud deployment. They used the platform-generated analytics to identify and eliminate waste, optimize compute instances, and right-fit storage choices. This ensures their deployments are always available, performant, and cost-optimized, so the bank can achieve the lowest cost without sacrificing their performance needs.
