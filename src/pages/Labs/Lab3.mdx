## Analyze a container right-sizing performance recommendation

Letâ€™s explore one of the performance recommendations in more detail.

1. On the Action Details page, if the details are not already expanded, click Expand Details.

2. Review the performance action details. Point out the recommendation to upsize the virtual CPU limit from 600 mCores to 700 mCores.

CPU throttling directly impacts the response time of a service and therefore user experience. Turbonomic observes and tracks CPU throttling. In the case of RobotShop, the response time latency of the payment service can adversely impact the ecommerce checkout experience.
Given the rate of throttling being observed, Turbonomic recommends increasing the CPU limit from 600 mCores to 700 mCores. Proactively alleviating CPU congestion pressures by providing these analytics-driven recommendations helps keep the application in the desired state where it meets its defined service-level objectives (SLOs).

3. The state of this action is, "Action can be accepted and executed immediately." Click on the "Execute Action" button to make the action changes.
