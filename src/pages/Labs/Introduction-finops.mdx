Gen-Z Bank is a financial services platform catering primarily to millennials. The bank has just wrapped up its cloud migration initiative. All mission-critical workloads were successfully lifted-and-shifted to AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). However, this transition has resulted in soaring cloud costs, and the bank’s monthly cloud bills have been getting regular executive attention from the financial team. The CIO has formed a new FinOps group to address the issue.

In this demo, I’ll show you how the IBM Turbonomic platform helps the FinOps team at Gen-Z Bank control their cloud costs.

The FinOps Lab is divided into four sections:

- Getting a global view of multi-cloud costs and savings opportunities
- Rightsizing compute instances
- Optimizing storage volumes
- Leveraging cloud provider discounts

Let’s start with some basics. In the public cloud pricing model, the total spend is calculated by multiplying the resources you’re consuming by the rate you’re paying. Therefore, cloud cost savings can be realized by either reducing consumption or lowering your rate.
