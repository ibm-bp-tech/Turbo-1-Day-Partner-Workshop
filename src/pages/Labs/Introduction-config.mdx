# Add Targets

For Turbonomic to perform intelligent workload balancing, it collects raw data from its 
targets like:
- APM Solutions (Instana, Dynatrace, New Relic, Cisco AppDynamics), 
- Hypervisors (Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware vCenter), 
- Public Cloud (Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure 
Service),
- Cloud Native Targets (OpenShift, Pivotal Kubernetes Service, Amazon Elastic, 
Kubernetes Service (EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Cisco Container 
Platform (CCP), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) 
- ...etc. 

Turbonomic polls its targets at 10-minute intervals to collect the latest data samples. It 
then uses these 10-minute data points for analysis and to display data in the GUI. 
Turbonomic also uses targets to execute actions in your environment to further optimize
the underlying infrastructure resources. Turbonomic communicates with the target via 
the management protocol it exposes like REST API, SMI-S, XML, or some other 
management transport.<br />
In this lab you will establish integration between Turbonomic and two targets:

1. Instana APM<br />
Turbonomic supports discovery of applications that are managed by the Instana 
platform. Turbonomic. includes the discovered information about these 
applications in its calculations for environment health.
2. Kubernetes<br />
With Cloud Native targets, Turbonomic discovers entities related to container 
platforms in your environment. Discovery can also stitch the container cluster 
entities together with managed applications. For example, discovery can show 
the full application stack if your container environment includes applications 
managed by technology like Instana APM. 

**Tip:** Turbonomic must be on a network with access to the specific services you want to set up as targets. (but we have this part covered for this session)
