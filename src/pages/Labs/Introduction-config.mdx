# Add Targets

A target is a service that performs management in your virtual environment. Turbonomic uses targets to monitor workload and execute actions in your environment. Turbonomic communicates with the target via the management protocol it exposes â€” The REST API, SMI-S, XML, or some other management transport. Turbonomic uses this communication to discover the managed entities, monitor resource utilization, and execute actions.

**Tip:** Turbonomic must be on a network with access to the specific services you want to set up as targets. (but we have this part covered for this session)
