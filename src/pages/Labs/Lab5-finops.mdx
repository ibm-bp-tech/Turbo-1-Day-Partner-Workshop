## 5.1	Understand current pre-paid commitments

We’ve seen two primary ways in which the bank can reduce consumption: rightsizing compute instances and optimizing storage. In a cloud pricing model, this directly impacts the usage levels and therefore has a direct consequence on the bank’s cloud bill. The other variable of this cloud spend equation is the unit price the bank pays for these resources.

All cloud providers offer discounts (typically up to 70% of the on-demand prices) in exchange for commitments of usage. These discounts can greatly reduce the rates. It’s financially beneficial for the bank to run as many workloads as possible under these discounts.

Keeping track of reservations, monitoring utilization levels, and planning for additional purchases require visibility and continuous management oversight by the FinOps team. Doing all this across a growing multi-cloud environment is almost impossible to do manually.

Let’s look at how the Turbonomic platform helps the bank manage pre-paid capacity. As always, the first step to rate optimization is to get visibility into existing pre-paid reservations.
#### Step 5.1.1	In the Discount Inventory panel of the global cloud view, click SHOW ALL.

#### Step 5.1.2

The ‘Discount Inventory’ panel shows the bank’s discounted pricing commitments with their cloud providers. Let’s explore the ‘AWS Reserved Instances’ tab.

Above the table, we see the total number of reserved instances, monthly cost, and monthly savings (1). In the table, each row represents an individual reservation, and the columns show the basic information about the reserved instance. All this information is automatically discovered from the bank’s cloud provider.

At a high level, we can see which accounts own the reservation (2), the instance type covered by this reservation (3), and whether it’s a standard or convertible reserved instance (4). The bank uses the ‘Est. Savings’ (5) and ‘Effective Cost’ (6) columns to quantify the ROI from purchasing these reserved instances.

#### Step 5.1.3

## 5.2	Examine utilization levels of existing discounts
When used properly, reserved instances can deliver up to a 70% discount compared to on-demand prices. Reserved instances that aren’t consumed during the commitment period are forfeited. Hence, an awareness of what reservations the bank owns and how well they are utilized is necessary to maximize their ROI. Let’s take a look at RI utilization.

#### Step 5.2.1
In the Discount Utilization dashboard, hover over the AWS RI data point on the black vertical line.

The graph shows the bank’s reservation utilization data pulled from their cloud providers. The black line represents the current time. Data points to the left of the black vertical line represent historical data, while data points to the right are projections into the future. AWS uses Normalized Factor Units (NFUs), and Azure uses ratios as a uniform measure of compute capacity to help normalize capacity across different instance types.

The graph shows current utilization of AWS at around 8% and of Azure at around 73%. As part of the optimization process, Turbonomic predicts that reservation utilization levels will increase to 60% and 90% for AWS and Azure respectively.

The bank’s underlying goal here is to maximize the utilization of their inventory and cover as many workloads as possible. In this way, they can take advantage of these highly discounted prices and reduce their total cost of ownership.

## 5.3	Explore the additional RI purchase recommendations

#### Step 5.2.1
In the Recommended RI Purchases dashboard, click SHOW ALL.

#### Step 5.3.2
Click DETAILS on the first row for additional information.

Reservations require a commitment and cost money. An all-upfront reservation provides the largest return, but it requires the full payment at the time of purchase. This is a bit contrary to the pay-as-you-go cloud model. However, over the committed term of one or three years, Turbonomic computes the break-even point, which is the time when the amortized cost of reserved instances will be lower than paying the on-demand prices.
#### Step 5.3.3	Point out the details on the Action Details panel, as highlighted in the screenshot and narration below.

Based on its analysis of the existing workloads, Turbonomic makes a recommendation to purchase additional reserved instances to ensure that more workloads are running at discounted prices (1).

When initially configuring Turbonomic, the bank set up a purchase profile indicating their preferences. Those preferences are then taken into account when making the recommendations on RI terms, such as one or three years (2), or RI class, such as standard or convertible (3).

Turbonomic estimates the bank will save an estimated 41.71% from purchasing these discounts (4).

#### Step 5.3.4
Click X to close the Action Details panel.

#### Step 5.3.5
Click X to close the Reserved Instances panel.

By leveraging cloud provider discounts, the bank is able to significantly reduce their cost per unit. In addition, Turbonomic can automate any of its recommendations — not just for RIs, but also for compute and storage optimization. The bank is able to define specific automation policies that enable them to execute these recommendations in real time, directly from the Turbonomic platform.
