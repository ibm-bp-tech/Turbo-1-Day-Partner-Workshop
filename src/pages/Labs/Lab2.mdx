Examine RobotShop resource dependencies
Now that we have a broad understanding of the global view, let’s examine the health of the RobotShop application. This is called “scoping.”

1. Click the RobotShop link to scope to RobotShop. *If RobotShop is not visible, click "Show All"

2. Point out that we are scoped to RobotShop, with data coming from Instana.

The supply chain can ingest data from a number of APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools. In this case, the supply chain is scoped to RobotShop, and the charts provide a quick view of RobotShop’s overall operating health.

Since RobotShop is a Kubernetes-based cloud native application, all the entities in the supply chain are specific to a container infrastructure.

3. On the Pending Actions chart, click SHOW ALL.

- If the Actions Panel displays "No Data", Turbo may need a few more minutes to populate fully. Validate all previous steps have been completed, call over an instructor if it continues to persist.

The Turbonomic engine performs an ongoing (real-time) holistic analysis of the environment, generating resource optimization recommendations (and associated actions) that you can follow to resolve and avoid emerging problems.

Here we see container resize actions, categorized as ‘performance’ and ‘efficiency’ actions. These are displayed for you to either investigate further or execute manually.

Performance: Container resize UP actions are typically performance-centric actions that are driven to resolve an underlying resource congestion issue.

Efficiency: Container resize DOWN actions are typically efficiency-centric actions that are pointing to a resource optimization opportunity, likely a consequence of resource over- provisioning.

4. On the Action Center panel, under RESIZE, find the "shipping" workload controller and select "DETAILS"
